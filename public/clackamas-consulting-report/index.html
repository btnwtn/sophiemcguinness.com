<h1>Clackamas Community College and the Oregon Promise Grant</h1>


<h2>Executive Summary & Problem Statement:</h2>
 
<p>We addressed three main research questions:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Did OPG induce more underserved student populations to attend Clackamas Community College (specifically rural, Hispanic and low-income)?</li>
  <li>Did OPG help recipients attend more semesters of college (persist)?</li>
<li>How does the policy climate and results surrounding OPG compare with other state promise programs?</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The answers to these questions lead us to a set of recommendations both at the state and Clackamas college policy levels.</p>
 
<h2>Data & Methods:</h2>
 
<p>To assess the impact that the Oregon Promise Grant had on the Clackamas Community College population we used data from the Clackamas Financial Aid Office. The data represent all students who applied for financial aid in the 2016 and 2017 school year, representing about 8,000 of the annual 22,000 students at Clackamas per year. All of the students in our sample attend college at least half-time, filled out the FAFSA and are degree-seeking. It is important to note that not all students who are eligible for financial aid apply for it, especially given the relatively early FAFSA deadline. Therefore, we cannot examine certain students who may have been eligible for Oregon Promise but who did not apply for financial aid.</p>
 
<h2>Findings:</h2>
 
<p>Finding I: The Oregon Promise Grant may have induced more low-income students to attend Clackamas Community College, but funds were distributed mostly to higher-income students. Ethnically, Clackamas is more diverse than Oregon, but Rural students are still underrepresented.</p>

<p>Overall, 700 students from Clackamas received the Oregon Promise grant. Demographically, these students generally reflected the overall Clackamas population: they were largely white and non-Hispanic, however, they were much more likely to be low income (61% compared with 33% overall) and slightly more likely to come from rural areas (5.8% compared with 3.9% overall). This suggests that Oregon Promise may have induced more low-income students to attend Clackamas: students in the 4th quartile of all adjusted gross income grew by over 1,000 students, increasing their share of the student financial-aid applicant body from 16% to 33%.
